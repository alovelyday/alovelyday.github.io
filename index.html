    <h3>Ingredients for A Lovely Day</h3>
    <p>The first thing that I do is get outside of my four walls; then I breathe in deep and mix with fresh air on a Spring-like day.</p>

          <h4>Cool Temperatures</h4>
          <h5>67-78&degF (no hotter please)</h5>
          <p>There is just something about cool temperatures that I find refreshing to my senses and physical well being. I have enjoyed cool temperatures more than any other temperature my whole life. And I have lived most of my years to this date.</p>

          <h4>Gotta Have A Latte!</h4>
          <h5></h5>
          <p>The delightful, delicious taste of a hot coffee beverage (from my favorite coffee house) paired with the cool temperatures, are an amazing combination for a lovely day.</p>

          <h4>Scenery Plays a Huge Part</h4>
          <h5></h5>
          <p>Large flower pots filled with Sweet Peas, a water fountain and people passing by downtown were all part of my lovely day today. Oh...and I certainly had my delightful and delicious latte! Yummmmmm!</p>

          <h5></h5>
          <p>What ingredients is your lovely day consisted of? Do you like big flower pots filled with flowers or do you prefer small house plants? Do you like to be around lots of people in the city or are you more interested in being in a quiet place? Do you enjoy watching a water fall or do you enjoy sports on the water? Whatever your choices are, I'm sure it's amazing!</p>

          <h5></h5>
